ClassySocial
============

This is a jQuery plugin that lets your site visitors easily see what networks you belong to and visit them in a click of a button. The original plugin is hosted here: http://www.class.pm/files/jquery/classysocial/

This plugin is an extension of the original one, version 2.2.0.

The features I've implemented are:

 * Removed support for HTML5 attributes in favor of JSON options
 * Added texts customization from options
 * Added ability to add new networks from the options
 * Removed the need to add the duplicated data-networks option and each data-<network>-<handle> option
 * Main button image can be easily set from options when not fetched from a social network profile
 * Added ability to fetch the main button image from any network (as long as the network provides a way to link to a profile image)

The documentation on how to use this plugin is in the `index.html` file in the repository.
